# Javascript-Quiz
## Description

This project is a "quiz" made with javascript. The answers are given to you so the key to getting a good score is a fast reaction time. It ended up taking a lot of time and effort to complete this mainly because of the logic involved with getting everything to run smoothly without any errors. It did help me learn a lot about making applications with javascript and I plan to use the knowledge I gained here in future projects.


## Installation

There is no instilation required. Just go to the website and press start to begin.

## Usage

When you press start on the main menu the game will begin. The question at the top will tell you what button you need to push. Click the button that says "true" to move on to the next question. If you answer a question incorrectly you will be docked 2 seconds an the screen will flash red. When the game is over you will see your score, a reset button, and a button that says "high scores". If you click the "high scores" button you will be prompted to put in you initials. When you click submit your score will be added to the leaderboard and in local storage. The scores are ranked by points from highest to lowest
